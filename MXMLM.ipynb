    "This script currently consumes 1 file in eMunch's TEIXML format and converts it to a complete CMIF/TEIXML file. The script is customized to ensure high precision, with fallbacks designed around their particular TEIXML files. Be aware that CMIF is purely intended to represent correspondance between individuals, and as such there is *significant* (intentional) data loss in converting to the format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script targets documents that have been tagged with **\"brev\"** or **\"letter\"**, and extracts from these:\n",
    "1. Document ID, which is extrapolated to form an eMunch URL\n",
    "2. Document Author tends to be Edvard Munch, and he is given his customary VIAF ID\n",
    "3. Document Authored Date, which is converted to YYYY-MM-DD (or YYYY-MM, or YYYY) or a range that can be from or from-to\n",
    "4. Document Recipient(s), names and IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "... and then places these in a hierarchy: <CorrespDesc(DocumentID)><*Author*><*Date*/><*/Author*><*Recipient*(s)/>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The file I was provided does **not** specify locations, but I'm sure that we'll be able to work out how to add those if such information is available. Further development: use glob.glob<sup>(the yeast of thought and mind)</sup> to consume files by folder. Add location data? Redirect recipient IDs to VIAF?\n",
    "\n",
    "The script can be altered to target all documents with one or more recipients, but many of the documents within that criteria are drafts and/or notes. Alternatively, the script can be further restricted to target only letters with \"brev\"/\"letter\" type *and* one or more recipients - but the test file has 0 instances where this would have an effect.\n",
